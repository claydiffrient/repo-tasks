## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-tasks
cd repo-tasks
cargo install --path .
```

### From Crates.io (coming soon)

```bash
cargo install repo-tasks
```

### From Homebrew (coming soon)

```bash
brew install repo-tasks
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
tasks init

# Create a new task
tasks new

# List all todo tasks
tasks list

# Start working on a task (move to in-progress + create branch)
tasks start my-task

# Search for tasks
tasks search "bug fix"

# Save changes to git
tasks save
```

## Usage

### Initialize Repository

```bash
tasks init [--project-name NAME]
```

Creates a `.repo-tasks/` directory with the following structure:

```
.repo-tasks/
├── config.json
└── tasks/
    ├── todo/
    ├── in-progress/
    ├── testing/
    └── done/
```

### Create Tasks

```bash
tasks new
```

Interactively creates a new task with:
- Title (required)
- Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Optional description

Tasks are saved as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
ID: "20260109120000"
Title: Implement user authentication
Priority: High
Tags:
  - security
  - backend
---

Add JWT-based authentication to the API endpoints.
Includes login, logout, and token refresh functionality.
```

### List Tasks

```bash
# List tasks in a specific status
tasks list [STATUS]

# Filter by priority
tasks list --priority High

# Filter by tag
tasks list --tag security

# Combine filters
tasks list in-progress --priority Critical
```

### View Task Details

```bash
tasks show SLUG_OR_ID
```

Displays full task information including description, dependencies, and metadata.

### Update Tasks

```bash
tasks update SLUG_OR_ID
```

Interactively update task properties:
- Title
- Priority
- Tags
- Description

### Move Tasks

```bash
tasks move SLUG_OR_ID STATUS
```

Move tasks between statuses:
- `todo` - Not started
- `in-progress` - Currently working on
- `testing` - Ready for testing/review
- `done` - Completed

### Start Working on a Task

```bash
tasks start SLUG_OR_ID
```

Convenience command that:
1. Moves the task to `in-progress` status
2. Creates a git branch named `{id}-{slug}`
3. Checks out the new branch

This is the recommended way to begin work on a task as it sets up your workspace in one command.

### Search Tasks

```bash
tasks search QUERY
```

Full-text search with regex support. Searches across all task files and displays matching lines with context.

### Open in Editor

```bash
tasks open SLUG_OR_ID
```

Opens the task file in your `$EDITOR` or platform default editor.

### Save Changes

```bash
tasks save [-m "commit message"]
```

Commits all changes in `.repo-tasks/` to git. Auto-generates commit messages if not provided.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `.repo-tasks/config.json`:

```json
{
  "project_name": "my-project",
  "statuses": [
    "todo",
    "in-progress",
    "testing",
    "done"
  ],
  "priorities": [
    "Low",
    "Medium",
    "High",
    "Critical"
  ],
  "auto_commit": false
}
```

### Customization

You can customize:
- **Project name** - Display name for the project
- **Statuses** - Add custom workflow states
- **Priorities** - Define priority levels
- **Auto-commit** - Automatically commit after each change

## Task File Format

Tasks are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
ID: "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS"
Title: Task title
Priority: High
Tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
Blocks:
  - other-task-id
DependsOn:
  - dependency-id
---

Task description goes here.
Supports full Markdown formatting.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- **ID** (required) - Unique timestamp identifier
- **Title** (required) - Task title
- **Priority** (optional) - Task priority
- **Tags** (optional) - List of tags
- **Blocks** (optional) - IDs of tasks this task blocks
- **DependsOn** (optional) - IDs of dependency tasks

## Performance

`repo-tasks` is designed for speed:

| Operation | Target | Actual |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `init` | < 50ms | ~380ms |
| `list` | < 50ms | ~6ms |
| `show` | < 10ms | ~4ms |
| `search` | < 200ms | ~50ms |
| Binary size | < 5MB | 3.3MB |

## LLM Integration

`repo-tasks` is designed to be easily manipulated by AI agents:

1. **Simple file format** - Plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter
2. **Direct file access** - No database or complex API
3. **Self-documenting** - Structure is evident from examples
4. **Git-integrated** - Changes are versioned automatically

### Example LLM Workflow

```
Human: "Create a task for implementing search functionality"

LLM: [Reads config.json to understand structure]
     [Generates timestamp ID: 20260108160000]
     [Creates .repo-tasks/tasks/todo/20260108160000-implement-search.md]
     [Optionally runs: tasks save -m "Add search task"]
```

### MCP Server

For seamless integration with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible LLMs, `repo-tasks` includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install MCP server dependencies
cd mcp-server
npm install

# Configure in Claude Code
# Add to ~/.config/claude-code/mcp_settings.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repo-tasks": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/repo-tasks/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Available Tools:**
- `list_tasks` - List and filter tasks
- `show_task` - View task details
- `create_task` - Create new tasks
- `move_task` - Move tasks between statuses
- `start_task` - Begin work (move to in-progress + create branch)
- `search_tasks` - Full-text search
- `save_tasks` - Commit changes to git

With the MCP server, you can manage tasks through natural language in Claude Code. See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for detailed documentation.
